# Pepe - The Discord Bot

## About the project
The project / The bot Pepe was first published under the name Monolog.
Due to problems and a very poorly optimized bot, I decided to completely rewrite the project and create the bot **Pepe**. 
First as a privately hosted bot, Pepe is now open source on Github, and can be installed and used by anyone.
